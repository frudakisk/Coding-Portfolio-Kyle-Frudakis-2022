# Coding-Portfolio-Kyle-Frudakis-2022
This will be my portfolio that I will link with my resume as I apply for internships, and further into the future, career applications.


As of April 6th, 2022 I have commited to adding any and all projects that I complete to this repository. Furthermore, I will provide
a brief explination of each project here as well as give a rough estimate on when the project was completed. They will be in chronological order.


Side Project/alien_invasion (Summer 2018)
This project was something I took on by myself before entering college. I am very proud of it and it actually helped me better understand
the classes I would be taking my freshman year of college. Using python, I learned very basic database structures and when going into university,
we had to learn C++, which was easier for me because I already have a knowledge of some of the common topics. This game is basically my version
of Space Invaders, which is a classic arcade game.


Side Project/Escape_Room (Fall 2018)
This was my first project in C++. While I have many other class assignments in C++, I felt like this one was a nice one to add to my portfolio
as it expresses one of my many interest in programming. This program is a mini game that is filled with puzzles and some riddles. It is not perfect, as there are some ways to break the game. When I find the time, I can easily fix some of the issues. As of now, it is not very important
to me to fix them.


Logic and Design (Spring 2019)
These are just some portfolios from my logic & design class that I though would put me in a nice light. This was by far one my most favorite classes. I got to get hands on experience of the basic level of conditions such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR, and the rest of the bunch. I am very proud of these projects.


HTML Website (Summer 2020)
I believe is started this project just about when the COVID pandemic started. My older sister, who is a UX designer, brought up the challenge to me to create her a website. Since we were all stuck at home at this time, I took her up on the challenge. While front-end developement is not really my preference, I thought it would be a good skill to have some knowledge on. This project is my attempt to make a nice looking website (using Bootstrap) and have it something that is acceptable to a UX designer. Some photos may be missing because I had to transfer this project from an older computer to this computer and I notices I left some folders behind.


Operating Scheduling ALG FCFS (Spring 2020)
This was a class project for Computer Operating Systems class. In this project, I had to represent what First Come First Serve threading system looks like in an operating system. This was a fun project because it was something I had to really sit down and think about. The project was completed in C++


HashExperimentation (Spring 2022)
This project is more recent. In one of my classes (Algorithms Design and Analysis), we were discussing hash tables and their runtime (very nice runtime btw) and different ways to utilize them. With things such as chainging, direct addressing, open addressing, linear probing, and quadratic probing, I felt compeled to make a hashtable of my own. Since my professor scrutinizes Python and glorifies Java, I decided to create this project in Java. Being my first project in java, it was very similar to C++ so I found my way around it quickly. This project basically shows a hashtable becoming filled up using quadratic probing and open addressing. Since I used quadratic probing, it shows how secondary clustering can happen. Also, in some of the comments, you can comment them out and turn this into a linear probing hash table. Then we will see the effects of normal clustering.


Sudoku Solver (Spring 2022)
Taking a liking to Java, I decided to look up some fun projects to do with it. I came across this sudoku challenge, and being someone who enjoys the game, I thought this would be a nice logic puzzle to solve! To be honest, I did need some help from outside sources to complete this one but overall, I felt like this is a nice project to help represent myself. I used recursion in the main algorithm to help solve this problem! Don's ask me how it works now though because I am sure I have forgotten by now. 

CustomersShoppingCart (Spring 2022)
This project was a university group assignment where I was partnered with 3 other classmates. For this project, I stepped up as the leader to organize when things get done and making sure everyone was on track. The idea of this project was to use Java GUI libraries to immitate an online shopping cart experience similar to Amazon. There are several windows that work together but the core ability of this project was to add/remove items into your shopping cart and checkout at the end where the "cashier" tells you the total cost of your shopping experience. Also, the items in the store are actually limited, so when the user adds something to their cart and purchases it, the item quantity in the store will reflect that change. There are a lot of other little things going on in the background but my group and I did our best to create an online shopping cart experience! To run this application, it is prefered you have NetBeans on your computer and run it from there.

TaskScheduler (Spring 2022)
This was another university group project during the same semester as CustomersShoppingCart. I was a member of this project instead of a leader. This was my first time using Swift and developing a mobile application. For TaskScheduler, the idea was basically to create an application that would allow a user to create "jobs" for their workers and those jobs would be present on each workers screen. In other words, the admin can see all jobs created but workers can only see the jobs assigned to them. The workers have the ability to update the status of their job, comment on their job and look over the requirements for the job. This project was very fun and has sparked an interest in mobile development in me.

--------------------------------------------
I will continue to add projects to the portfolio. I have one big passion project coming up called Routine that helps people out in the gym. As of now (Spring 2022), it is functional but not perfect. I would still like to add some more functionality to it!
